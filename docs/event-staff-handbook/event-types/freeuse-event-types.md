# Free-Use Events üé≠

Free-Use events are special planning events where volunteer members (staff or regular members) act as "Free-Use," allowing attendees to come and pick a room with a Free-Use volunteer for fun time together.

:::info Event Type
These events aren't restricted to Patreon events; they also happen as regular events. Free-Use volunteers roleplay as restaurant staff, club staff, or similar, checking on customers while allowing free use in public areas or unlocked private rooms.
