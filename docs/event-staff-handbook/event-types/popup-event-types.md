# Pop-Up Events üöÄ

As a **Full Host** (<RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" />), you have the ability to host events as pop-ups. You **don't** have to request it from any higher-ups if you want to host a pop-up. Just make sure to **respect a few rules**.

## Event Overview

| Event Type        | Security (Min-Max) | Volunteers (Min-Max) | Attendees Expected |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Pop-Up Events** | 1-2                | 0-3                  | 25-40              |

Plan a late night post-event afterparty or fill in an open slot. Pop-up events can be any Classic Event Type.
