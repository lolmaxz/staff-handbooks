# Orgy Events

Orgy Night events are special planning events where attendees can engage in group activities. These events require careful planning and staffing to ensure safety and consent.

## Event Overview

| Event Type     | Security (Min-Max) | Volunteers (Min-Max) | Attendees Expected |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Orgy Night** | 2-4                | 1-3                  | 25-40              |

Night of making a hot sticky mess on some poor world creator's world.

:::info Important
**Designate a SFW/Aftercare area for attendees to cool off.**

## Special Event Planning Thread Requirement

:::danger ‚è∞ Critical Timing Requirement
**Orgy events are special planning events** and require a planning thread in <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="üìòspecial-event-planning" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/741166096421486645" /> to be opened **at least 24 hours in advance** of the event start time.

- **Minimum:** 24 hours in advance (required)
- **Preferred:** 2-3 days in advance
- **Best practice:** As soon as the schedule comes out

**Important:** If a planning thread is opened less than 24 hours before the event, the event will be **canceled** and changed to a regular event.

:::

## AU Timezone Exception

:::info üåè AU Timezone Hosting Exception
**ONLY if in an AU timezone**, a host is authorized to host an orgy event even if security is missing, but must follow a strict security-to-attendee ratio.

### Strict Security Ratio Rule

**1 security per 10 attendees maximum**

**Examples:**

- 1 security available = **10 attendees maximum**
- 2 security available = **20 attendees maximum**
- 3 security available = **30 attendees maximum**

:::warning Important Note
Being a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member **does not count** towards the security count! Only actual <RoleBadge role="Event Security" color="#3fa7ff" /> members count for this ratio.
:::

This exception only applies to AU timezone hosts due to the limited availability of security staff during those time slots.
