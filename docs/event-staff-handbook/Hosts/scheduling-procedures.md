# Scheduling Procedures

:::note
Event schedules run from _Monday to Sunday!_
:::

## Weekly Scheduling

### Wednesday/Thursday

- An <RoleBadge role="Event Committee" color="#db1cb8" /> member will post a new scheduling thread in <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="ðŸ“†event-scheduling" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1024399192300454029" /> for the next week's schedule.
- As a <RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" /> or <RoleBadge role="Event Trial" color="#f75edb" />, you are expected to fill out the availability template with your desired time slots, listing them in order of preference.

## Availability Templates

### Trial Host Template

If you're a <RoleBadge role="Event Trial" color="#f75edb" />, use the Trial Host Template:

**Instructions:**

- For each day, specify the **times** or **time ranges** you are available to potentially get trained
- Times must be in **EST** (Eastern Standard Time)
- You can provide a time range like `8pm->11pm` (available during that range)
- Use `+` for either time but not in between, like `8pm+11pm` (available at 8pm OR 11pm, not in between)
- If you are on your **second phase for Solo event**, you can also specify your **preferred event type** if you have a preference
- Include how many events you're willing to be trained on that week
- **You will also be responsible to reach out to trainers** to train you unless they do it first

</details>

### Host Template (or Trial in Solo Phase)

If you're a <RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" /> or a <RoleBadge role="Event Trial" color="#f75edb" /> in the solo phase, use the Host Template:

**Instructions:**

- For each time you give, you can specify if you are willing to offer training or not
- In case you want to do a special event or really want to host that event yourself without being asked to train on that day/event
- **If omitted, we will assume you don't mind training another Trial Host**
- Times must be in **EST** (Eastern Standard Time)
- You can provide a time range like `8pm->11pm` (available during that range)
- Use `+` for either time but not in between, like `8pm+11pm` (available at 8pm OR 11pm, not in between)
- Include how many events you're willing to host that week

**Example format for a day:**

- `â€¢ 9pm->11pm + Special Event` - Available between 9pm and 11pm EST for Special Events
- `â€¢ 7pm` - Available at 7pm EST (willing to train if needed)

</details>

:::tip ðŸ’– Managing Availability
This way you can give many availabilities, but scheduling will try to limit your hosting/training to the amount you specified! This helps manage workload and ensures fair distribution.
:::

---

### Saturday

- A rough draft of the schedule will be posted in the scheduling thread.
- The <RoleBadge role="Event Committee" color="#db1cb8" /> will ensure everyone is scheduled correctly and fairly.
- <RoleBadge role="Event Trial" color="#f75edb" /> may request training sessions with <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> members.

---

### Sunday

- Final changes will be made to the schedule around this time.
- The finalized schedule will be published in <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="ðŸ“†event-scheduling" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1024399192300454029" /> (staff) and <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="ðŸ“†event-schedule" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1234567890123456789" /> (public).

## Day of the Event

- The main <RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" /> is responsible for pinging the <RoleBadge role="Event Security" color="#3fa7ff" /> role to request security before the event starts.
- <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> can host without security (excluding big events).
- <RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" /> without available security may request permission to proceed without one.
- <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> or <RoleBadge role="Server Moderator" color="#e68027" /> can act as security if needed.

:::tip Don't Forget!
Communication is key! Ensure you're proactive in coordinating with security and other staff members.
:::

## Security Request Procedure

Follow this flowchart to determine when and how to request security based on your event type:

<CardGrid columns={3}>
  <Card title="Scheduled Classic Events*" status="info">
    <p><strong>START:</strong> Request security when Event Announcement is posted</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SECURITY 1hr prior:</strong> Request support</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SUPPORT:</strong> Only <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> can solo host*</p>
    <p style={{marginTop: "0.5rem", fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic"}}>
      *Solo hosting requires <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> status
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled Special Events" status="warning">
    <p><strong>START:</strong> Request security <strong>24-48hrs</strong> prior to Event</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SECURITY DAY OF:</strong> Request support</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SUPPORT:</strong> <span style={{color: "#dc2626", fontWeight: "bold"}}>CANCEL</span> - Ineligible for solo host</p>
    <p style={{marginTop: "0.5rem", fontSize: "0.9em"}}>
      Special events require security or support
    </p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unscheduled Popup Events" status="info">
    <p><strong>START:</strong> Request security <strong>before</strong> Event is requested in chat</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SECURITY 1hr prior:</strong> Request support</p>
    <hr style={{margin: "1rem 0"}} />
    <p><strong>IF NO SUPPORT:</strong> Only <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> can solo host</p>
    <p style={{marginTop: "0.5rem", fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic"}}>
      Popup events need advance security confirmation
    </p>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Request Escalation Path

1. **All <RoleBadge role="Event Host" color="#f75edb" />** / **<RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" />** â†’ Request from <RoleBadge role="Event Security" color="#3fa7ff" />
2. If no Security â†’ Request from <RoleBadge role="Server Moderator" color="#e68027" /> or <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" />
3. **<RoleBadge role="Server Moderator" color="#e68027" />** support â†’ Proceed with event
4. **<RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" />** support â†’ <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> can solo host\*
5. If no support available â†’ Follow event type rules above

:::note
_<RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" />_ can solo host Classic and Popup events when no security or support is available. Special events always require security or must be cancelled.
