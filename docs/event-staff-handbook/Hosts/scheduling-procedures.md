# Scheduling Procedures
:::note
Event schedules run from *Monday to Sunday!*
:::

## Weekly Scheduling

### Wednesday/Thursday

- An Event Committee member will post a new scheduling thread in **#event-scheduling** for the next week's schedule.
- As a Host or Event Trial, you are expected to fill out the availability template with your desired time slots, listing them in order of preference.

### Saturday

- A rough draft of the schedule will be posted in the scheduling thread.
- The Event Committee will ensure everyone is scheduled correctly and fairly.
- Event Trials may request training sessions with Senior Team members.

### Sunday

- Final changes will be made to the schedule around this time.
- The finalized schedule will be published in **#event-scheduling** (staff) and **#event-schedule** (public).

## Day of the Event

- The main Host is responsible for pinging the **Security** role to request security before the event starts.
- **Senior Hosts** can host without security (excluding big events).
- Hosts without available security may request permission to proceed without one.
- **Senior Hosts** or **Server Moderators** can act as security if needed.

:::tip Don't Forget!
Communication is key! Ensure you're proactive in coordinating with security and other staff members.
