# Hosting Requirements

- **Active Hosting**: You are expected to host events regularly and have fun while doing it!



- **Scheduling Participation**: Submit your hosting availability on time each week; Late submissions may result in not receiving hosting slots!

- **Professional Conduct**: Always act professionally, courteously, and respectfully toward staff and members; Be the life of the party and have fun while keeping everyone safe!

- **Conflict Resolution**: Just like security, try to avoid escalating drama! If you're in a conflict and need further help you can call on **HR** to help you!


:::warning Activity!
  *If you become too inactive, the Event Committee will reach out to see if you need a break or if you wish to leave the team. While there is no strict monthly minimum, please try to avoid going without hosting for 6 months without contacting!
