:::tip
Hosting an event involves several key steps:
:::

### **Scheduling:** Ensure you are scheduled to host the event.

### **Publish the Event:** Click the megaphone icon to publish your event.

### **Event Announcement:**

   - Make a post in **#events**, aiming for a minimum of **2-6 hours** prior to the start of the event.
   - If your announcement overlaps with another ongoing event, post it **1 hour after doors open** for that event.

### **Reminder Ping**: Send a 1-hour reminder in **#events**.

### **Event Pings During the Event:**

   - **10-15 minutes before start**: Ping **Patreon** members. If all signed-up patrons have joined, you can open the doors to regular members.
   - **On Time**: Send the general invite request notice.

### **Host the Event:**

   :::note info 
   Follow specific guidelines based on the event type (see [Event Types](classic-event-types.md)).
   :::

### **Post-Event:**

   - Report any incidents in **#events-incidents**.
   - Announce when the event ends and if the world capacity is full.
   - Send additional pings when new spots become available.
   - Allow **Purple** or **Golden** Icon Patreon members to join even if soft capacity is reached (unless it's a game event with limited slots or the hard cap is reached).

:::warning
Be punctual with pings and event start times. We understand technical issues can occur, but aim to get on early to handle any unforeseen problems.
