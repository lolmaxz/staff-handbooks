# Event Onboarding üéØ

Thank you for deciding to apply and becoming part of the Eden Apis Event Team! We're excited to have you join us, and we'll go over how training will commence and what will be expected from that training.

:::info Welcome!
All training will be the same regardless if you applied for Host or Security, consisting of training in both roles to:

1. Understand how the team works together better
2. Test you in both roles to see if you're a better fit for one or both

## Probation Period

:::warning ‚è∞ Important Timeline

- At the end of those 6 weeks, if you have not finished training yet, we'll look over your progress and pull you in to discuss with you.
- If we find you to be progressing well but just a bit slow, we'll discuss with you and give you an additional **2-3 weeks**.
- Otherwise, the probation period will end and removal from the team.

When training is completed, we'll look over how you performed in training and will vote on whether to make you full staff. **Staff in training for event side can still not be accepted at the end of the trial**, but we do our best to prepare them.

## Staff Conduct

Staff are the face of Eden. You're expected to not only uphold the rules but follow them to the letter yourselves. As such, be aware how you conduct yourself, as any issues that could arise could result in consequences.

## Getting Started: Event Scheduling

Your first step is to get scheduled for training!

1. **Wait for the weekly scheduling post**

   - Go to <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="üìÜevent-scheduling" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1024399192300454029" />
   - Wait until the next week's post is open (typically posted on Wednesday/Thursday)
   - If it's already open, you're good to go!

2. **Submit your availability template**

   - As a trial, you need to let the team know your availabilities to be trained
   - **You will also be responsible to reach out to trainers** to train you unless they do it first
   - When the scheduling thread is open, reply with your availability using the Trial Host Template below

   **Template Instructions:**

   - For each day, specify the **times** or **time ranges** you are available to potentially get trained
   - Times must be in **EST** (Eastern Standard Time)
   - You can provide a time range like `8pm->11pm` (available during that range)
   - Use `+` for either time but not in between, like `8pm+11pm` (available at 8pm OR 11pm, not in between)
   - If you are on your **second phase for Solo event**, you can also specify your **preferred event type** if you have a preference
   - Include how many events you're willing to be trained on that week

   **Copy this template** (remove the code block markers when posting):

   **Example format for a day:**

   - `‚Ä¢ 9pm->11pm` - Available between 9pm and 11pm EST

   </details>

3. **You'll be paired with a trainer**
   - The <RoleBadge role="Event Committee" color="#db1cb8" /> will pair you with a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member that matches your schedule for getting trained
   - Training sessions will be coordinated based on both your availabilities
   - This way you can give many availabilities, but scheduling will try to limit your hosting/training to the amount you specified! üíñ

:::tip Finding Senior Staff
Check the schedule in <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="üìÜevent-scheduling" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1024399192300454029" />. Look for the <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> or <RoleBadge role="Event Committee" color="#db1cb8" /> icons next to people's names, or check server profiles to see who's in these groups.

Once you find an event hosted by a Senior Event Staff or Committee Member, ask them in <ChannelBadge label="üìòevents-organization" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/741166096421486645" /> if they can train you during their scheduled event.
