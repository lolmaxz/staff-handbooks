## The Clear "NO" Rule

The **Clear "NO"** rule is signified by crossing your arms in an "X" shape. It means that any interaction must stop immediately. This applies to everyone, including staff. As Hosts or Security, you are responsible for watching out for this sign and ensuring others respect it.

:::note Consent is Priority #1
As always, consent is our number one priority. For Desktop users, you can use the 🚫 emote.

## The Eden Consent Badges

Eden Consent Badges are visual indicators that members can add to their avatars. They help communicate consent preferences. Hosts and Security should recognize what each badge color means:

- **🔴 Red**: No consent; do not touch; do not ask.
- **🟡 Yellow**: Consent to touch, but you must ask first.
- **🟢 Green**: Consent to touch is given; no need to ask.
- **🔵 Blue**: Same as green, but actively looking to be lewd.
