# Event Trial Training 🎓

After acceptance as an Event Team member, you will receive the <RoleBadge role="Event Trial" color="#f75edb" /> role and access to event channels.

:::note 📝 Trial Requirements
Your trial period requires you to actively staff a minimum of **6 events** in total.
:::

They consist of both security and host training, including:

1. **🛡️ Security Shadowing (2 Events)**: Observe a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member performing security duties and learn from their experience.

2. **👁️ Security While Observed (1 Event)**: Act as the main security with oversight from a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member, who will help with any questions you may have.

3. **🤝 Co-Hosting (1 Event)**: Share hosting responsibilities, applying learned skills while still supported by a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member.

4. **🎯 Solo Hosting with Co-Host Support (1 Event)**: Lead an event with backup from a <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member as co-host, allowing you to become more confident.

5. **✨ Solo Hosting with Shadowing Host (1 Event)**: Conduct an event independently while a Senior Host observes, demonstrating your full capability in managing an event.

## 📊 Feedback and Evaluation

For each event:

- A <RoleBadge role="Senior Event Team" color="#3fa7ff" /> member will take notes on your performance.
- Feedback will cover key areas such as event announcements, event invites, start-of-event announcements, event hosting, and any other noteworthy aspects.
- Constructive criticism will be provided to help you improve.

## 📅 Submitting Your Availability

As a trial, you need to let the team know your availabilities to be trained. **You will also be responsible to reach out to trainers** to train you unless they do it first.

### How to Fill Out the Template

- In your schedule template, specify for each day what **times** or **time ranges** you are available to potentially get trained
- Times must be in **EST** (Eastern Standard Time)
- If you are on your **second phase for Solo event**, you can also specify your **preferred event type** if you have a preference
- Include how many events you're willing to be trained on that week

### Time Format Examples

- **Single time:** `8pm`
- **Time range:** `8pm->11pm` (available during that entire range)
- **Either/or (not in between):** `8pm+11pm` (available at 8pm OR 11pm, not in between)

### Trial Host Template

Copy this template when submitting your availability in the weekly scheduling thread (remove the code block markers when posting):

:::tip 💖 Helpful Note
This way you can give many availabilities, but scheduling will try to limit your hosting/training to the amount you specified! This helps manage your workload and ensures fair distribution.
