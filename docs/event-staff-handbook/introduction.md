| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lewd Social**         | 1                          | 25–40                      | Classic social event based around getting people into a world and talking with each other (mirror dwelling, sharing music, or playing games in chill worlds).<br/><br/>_Drinking is allowed but not the main focus._                                                              |
| **Nude Social**         | 1                          | 25–40                      | Social event where all participants are encouraged to strip down as much as they feel comfortable, showing off their avatars to break the ice and remove any awkwardness about undressing.                                                                                        |
| **Movie/Cuddle Puddle** | 1                          | 25–40                      | An event that caters to a mostly SFW cuddle session—everyone can watch a movie together in-world or just vibe out and chat.<br/><br/>_Designate a <strong>SFW</strong> area to cuddle, and leave the rest of the map as <strong>NSFW</strong> zones for those seeking extra fun._ |
| **Game Night**          | 1                          | 15–35                      | Pick a game world that can hold at least 15–20 participants by size. You can mix and match multiple worlds, or let attendees vote on the games they want to play.<br/><br/>_Keep any dares aimed at the group rather than individuals to maintain event flow._                    |
| **Karaoke Night**       | 1                          | 25–40                      | Bust out your best songs! This can be themed karaoke or totally random. Encourage everyone to pick their own songs, show off their talent (or lack thereof), or even set up group performances.                                                                                   |

World-hop to scenic locations to spark imagination and creativity.<br/><br/>_Meme it up to make it fun (you may ignore meme avatar rules), or add a lewd option for those who want it._                             |

## Expectations & Professionalism

As part of the Eden Apis **staff**, you are expected to remain professional and courteous. While we understand that everyone has their own personality and style, treating all members with respect is a **must**.

:::note
Remember, we’re not customer service workers. You’re not expected to put on a fake smile 24/7, but you should always handle situations with fairness and professionalism.

## Keeping Up with Updates 🔄

The Event Team Handbook is a **living document**, meaning it will be updated as needed. When changes are made, a staff announcement will be posted in the **Discord server**, so make sure to stay informed.
