| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lewd Social**         | 1                          | 25–40                      | Classic social event based around getting people into a world and talking with each other (mirror dwelling, sharing music, or playing games in chill worlds).<br/><br/>_Drinking is allowed but not the main focus._                                                              |

| **Game Night**          | 1                          | 15–35                      | Pick a game world that can hold at least 15–20 participants by size.
