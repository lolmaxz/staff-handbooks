# Incident Management Guidelines

## General Guidelines

1. **Primary Responsibility**: Event Security is tasked with maintaining order. Their main role is to address troublemakers promptly to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all server members.

2. **Issuing Warnings**:

   - Security should issue warnings whenever possible.
   - If no security member is available, Hosts can step in.
   - Speak clearly and firmly when delivering a verbal warning.

3. **Handling Offenders**:

   - Move the offending member(s) away from others, ensuring privacy during the discussion.
   - Collect detailed information about the incident.
   - Observe the member's behavior, noting any aggression for the incident report.

4. **Logging Incidents**:

   - After dealing with the situation, log the incident in **#events-incidents**.
   - Include:

     - Offender's Discord Tag (without pinging them).
     - Detailed account of the incident:

       - Specific rules broken.
       - All people involved.
       - Notable statements made during the incident and discussion.

     - Disciplinary actions taken.

## Specific Rule Violations and Actions

- **Broken Consent**:

  - Includes unwanted physical contact, boundary violations, coercion into ERP, and advances on non-consenting members.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning and/or removal from the event (for serious consent breaks).

- **Disorderly Conduct**:

  - Includes being excessively loud, using offensive language, inciting violence, and triggering members' sensitivities.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning to cease immediately; removal at team's discretion.

- **Inciting Drama**:

  - Involves speaking negatively about members or staff, spreading rumors, igniting debates, or discussing server tickets inappropriately.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning to cease immediately.

:::tip Host Authority
At any time, you have the right as the **Host** to remove any rule breaker from your ongoing event if you consider it to be appropriate, just make sure to communicate with security the issue, and write up a ticket for the incident!

## Record Keeping and Consequences

- Make sure **all** incidents are recorded in **#events-incidents** and the Eden Apis Host Quick References.
- Multiple reports against a user within a certain time frame can lead to a ban from events.
