# Incident Management Guidelines

## 1. Primary Responsibility

Event Security is tasked with maintaining order. Their main role is to address troublemakers promptly and discreetly to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all server members during events .

## 2. Issuing Warnings

- Security should issue warnings whenever possible.
- If no security member is available, Hosts can step in.
- Speak clearly and firmly when delivering a verbal warning.

## 3. Handling Offenders

- <u>Move the offending member(s) away from others</u>, ensuring privacy during the discussion.
- Collect detailed information about the incident.
- Observe the member's behavior, noting any aggression for the incident report.

:::tip De-escalation/preventing aggression
Our staff should always be trying to maintain a stern but respectful tone in order to prevent members from becoming aggitated. If member becomes escalatory grab another active staff or an off duty staff at the event to also serve as witness to their attitude prior to logging the incident and attitude of the member.
:::

:::tip Staff Unity & Coordination
If there is a disagreement between host and security staff, or if different directives were given from both staff to members, both staff members need to:

1. Move away from the group/attendee
2. Discuss the situation privately in the event VC
3. Reach a point of agreement
4. Return with a unified decision

This approach helps maintain team coherence and presents a united front to event attendees, which is crucial for effective incident management.
:::

:::important Personal Limitations & Fair Treatment
If you find yourself unable to handle a situation with an attendee for any personal reason:

- Personal relationship with the attendee
- Need to step away from VR
- Emotional state
- Any other circumstance affecting your judgment

You MUST:

1. Request another staff member to take over the situation
2. Properly brief them on the situation
3. Step away completely to ensure consistent treatment

DO NOT:

- Rush through the situation just to get it done
- Handle it differently because of personal relationships
- Try to "wing it" when you're not in the right state
- Show favoritism or bias in your handling

Remember: Every attendee deserves the same level of professional treatment, regardless of their relationship with staff members.
