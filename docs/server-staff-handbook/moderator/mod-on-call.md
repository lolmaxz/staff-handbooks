# Mod on Call (Moderators Only)

The **Mod on Call** is responsible for closing out tickets and updating the GitHub records for the week.

## Selection Process

- **Every Friday**, a member of the <RoleBadge role="Server Committee" badgeIcon="server_committee_role_icon.webp" color="#db1cb8" /> or the <RoleBadge role="Head Moderator ðŸ”°" badgeIcon="" color="#db1cb8" /> opens a thread in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“—helper-chat" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1234567890123456789"/>.
- <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> roll a die using `/roll sides20` with YAGPDB bot.
- In true D&D fashion, the Mod with the **lowest roll** becomes the Mod on Call until the next Friday!

  - In case of a tie, previous week's Mod on Call wins the tie.
  - Other Mods who tie will roll again.

- If the <RoleBadge role="Head Moderator ðŸ”°" badgeIcon="" color="#db1cb8" /> or <RoleBadge role="Server Committee" badgeIcon="server_committee_role_icon.webp" color="#db1cb8" /> member doesn't start the roll thread by **midnight EST**, they will take over the duties by default.

:::note
This process helps ensures fair rotation of responsibilities and makes it fun!
