# Mod on Call

The **Mod on Call** is the <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> responsible for closing out tickets and updating the GitHub records for the week.

## How It Works

- One <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> is assigned each week as the **Mod on Call**.
- Responsibility rotates through the Moderator team in a **fixed order**.
- The schedule is tracked via a **Google Sheet** so each Moderator knows when they are expected to handle ticket logging.
- A smaller extraction from the full schedule is pinned in <ChannelBadge label="📙moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/>.

## Schedule Swaps

If a <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> cannot complete their assigned week:

- They **must arrange a swap** with another Moderator
- Update the roster accordingly
- Alternatively, another Moderator may **volunteer to cover** the assigned week instead of a swap

## Responsibilities

The Mod on Call for the week is responsible for:

1. **Closing out completed tickets** throughout the week
2. **Updating the GitHub Warning Book** with all logged actions
3. **Ensuring all records are properly documented** before the week ends
