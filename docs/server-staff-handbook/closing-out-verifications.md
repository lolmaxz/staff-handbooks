# Closing Out Verifications

A second check of the verification ticket is required:

- Any <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> will perform this step for <RoleBadge role="Cutie Helpers" badgeIcon="cutie_helper_role_icon.png" color="#308027" /> initial verifications.
- If a <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> did the initial verification, a separate <RoleBadge role="Second Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> shall close out the ticket.

## Procedure

---

### Role Selection

- Ensure the <RoleBadge role="Unverified" badgeIcon="unverified_role_icon.png" color="#de0000" /> is <Tooltip tip="Hephia will automatically remove the unverified role when a member is granted the verified role." bubbleColor="#d255ec" width="20rem" labelColor="#e68027"> removed </Tooltip> from the member and <RoleBadge role="Verified" color="#008800" /> has been given to the member.
- Ensure the member has selected appropriate roles.
- Verify the age category matches to prevent members from faking their age.

---

### Reminder Pings

- Send up to <Tooltip tip="~24 hours between reminders" bubbleColor="#d255ec" width="13rem" labelColor="#e68027"> **2 reminder pings** </Tooltip> after the welcome message.
- If no roles are selected after **48 hours**, you may proceed to close the ticket if verification is satisfactory.

---

### Closing the Ticket

- Use the <DiscordButton type="error" emoji="ðŸ”’">Close With Reason</DiscordButton> button of the ticket bot. _(It should be at the top of the ticket)_
- The reason should be: `"Verification Complete - [Name of staff member who did verification] Closed By- [Name of staff member who performed the second check]"`
  :::note Example
  "Verification Complete - Del Closed By- Solii"
  :::
  :::info
  Properly closing out tickets ensures accurate record-keeping and helps maintain an organized verification process.
  :::

---

### No Response Cases

- If the user hasn't responded or provided an ID after **72 hours**, you can close the ticket with the reason: `"No Response >72hrs"`
- For tickets without any post from the user for verification after **48 hours**, use: `"No Verification in >48hrs"`

:::danger HEPHIA IS OFFLINE
When closing verification tickets; <u>**double check that hephia is online first!!**</u> If Hephia is <u>**offline**</u> you will have to manually delete the verification threads after closing with the bot.
