# Closing Out Verifications (Moderators Only)

A second check of the verification ticket is required:

- **Moderators** perform this step for Cutie Helpers.
- If a Moderator did the initial verification, a **second Moderator** should close out the ticket.

## Procedure

1. **Role Selection**:

   - Ensure the member has selected appropriate roles.
   - Verify the age category matches to prevent minors from faking their age.

2. **Reminder Pings**:

   - Send up to **2 reminder pings** after the welcome message (24 hours apart).
   - If no roles are selected after **48 hours**, you may proceed to close the ticket if verification is satisfactory.

3. **Closing the Ticket**:

   - Use the **"Close with Reason"** function of the ticket bot.
   - The reason should be: `"Verification Complete - [Name of staff member who did verification] Closed By- [Name of staff member who performed the second check]"`
     _Example_: `Verification Complete - Del Closed By- Solii`

4. **No Response Cases**:

   - If the user hasn't responded or provided an ID after **72 hours**, you can close the ticket with the reason: `"No Response >72hrs"`
   - For tickets without any post from the user for verification after **48 hours**, use: `"No Verification in >48hrs"`
