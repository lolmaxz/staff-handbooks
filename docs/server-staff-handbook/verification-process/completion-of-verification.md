# Initial Verification Process Complete

:::warning MUTUAL EXCLUSIVITY

No member should ever have both the <RoleBadge role="VRC Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role and the regular <RoleBadge role="Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role at the same time. If someone tries to do go through the ID verification process while having the <RoleBadge role="VRC Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role, you may inform them that only one form of verification is needed. If they want to go through the ID verification process, please remove the <RoleBadge role="VRC Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role when you give them the <RoleBadge role="Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role.

:::
Once initial verification meets all required criteria:

1. **Welcome Message**:

   - Send a welcome message to the member.
   - Include important channels and information (see template below).

2. **Adjust Roles**:

   - Assign the <RoleBadge role="Verified" color="#00ff00" /> role.
   - If the bot (Hephia) is down, manually remove the <RoleBadge role="Unverified" color="#ff0000" /> role.

:::danger Verification Image Deletion
If the member deletes their verification images after the initial verification is completed, please ask them to repost the images in order for a moderator to double check the verification. If they do not comply in a timely manner, you are allowed to give back their <RoleBadge role="Unverified" color="#ff0000" /> role and inform them that their verification has been temporarily revoked.

    <span style={{ fontSize: "1.4rem", fontWeight: 600 }}>
