# Initial Verification Process Complete

Once initial verification meets all required criteria:

1. **Welcome Message**:

   - Send a welcome message to the member.
   - Include important channels and information (see template below).

2. **Adjust Roles**:

   - Assign the **Verified** role.
   - If the bot (Hephia) is down, manually remove the **Unverified** role.

:::danger
If the member deletes their verification images after the initial verification is completed, please ask them to repost the images in order for a moderator to double check the verification. If they do not comply in a timely manner, you are allowed to give back their unverified role and inform them that their verification has been temporarily revoked.

## Welcome Message Template

You can customize the welcome message, but it should include the following:

```markdown
# Thank you @username for getting verified!

## Here are some important things to keep in mind:

### - **[Server Rules](#rules-channel-link)**
