# Initial Verification Process Complete
:::warning

No member should ever have both the "vrc verified" role and the regular "verified" role at the same time. If someone tries to do go through the ID verification process while having the "vrc verified" role, you may inform them that only one form of verification is needed. If they want to go through the ID verification process, please remove the "vrc verified" role when you give them the "verified" role.

:::
Once initial verification meets all required criteria:

1. **Welcome Message**:

   - Send a welcome message to the member.
   - Include important channels and information (see template below).

2. **Adjust Roles**:

   - Assign the **Verified** role.
   - If the bot (Hephia) is down, manually remove the **Unverified** role.

:::danger
If the member deletes their verification images after the initial verification is completed, please ask them to repost the images in order for a moderator to double check the verification. If they do not comply in a timely manner, you are allowed to give back their unverified role and inform them that their verification has been temporarily revoked.

```markdown
# Thank you @username for getting verified!
