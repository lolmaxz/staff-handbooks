# Staff-Talk Tickets
:::info
**For the first 2 months** as a <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" />, draft your messages in **#ðŸ“™moderator-only** and get approval from a <RoleBadge role="Server Committee Member" badgeIcon="server_committee_role_icon.webp" color="#db1cb8" /> before opening tickets.

## Important Guidelines

- **Punishment/Action Tickets**

  - Punishment tickets <u>**must**</u> be opened by **Staff**.
  - <u>**Only**</u> **1** staff member may talk within a ticket at a time. <u>Do not dogpile into the ticket</u>
  - Do **not** give out any punishments in tickets started by a member.
  - **Never** start the ticket by stating the punishment.
:::note Reminder
While these tickets will be used to dish out a punishment, we still wanna treat the members with respect!

## **Setting up a Ticket** 
  1. Go to **#open-a-ticket** and select **"Talk to a Staff"** button.
  2. Rename the ticket using `/rename` to: `Stafftalk-Username`.
  3. Add the user to the ticket with `/add`.

---

## **Communicating with the Member**
  - Ping the user and request their time.
  - Share evidence of the rule they broke.
  - Explain the rule and how they violated it.

    - Please do not argue with the member.
  - If it gets to be too much, tag out for another <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“™moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/>.
:::warning Don't Stress!
Remain calm and objective! If you feel yourself getting frustrated, please just do an "Irish Goodbye" from the ticket and ask for help!

<details>
<summary> **Issuing Punishments** </summary>
<p>
  - Inform them of the punishment according to the **Staff Guidelines** and ask them to acknowledge the punishment.
  :::warning

**Do not remove the member before they have acknowledged the punishment.** This is very important, as it is the only way for us to prove that they have read, understood what they did wrong, and the warning/punishment they are receiving. If they do not respond within <u>two weeks</u> or you see them very clearly being active in other parts of the server and intentionally ignoring the ticket, you may request to  **temporarily remove their verifcation until they respond** in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“™moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/>. This is done by adding back the <RoleBadge role="Unverified Role" badgeIcon="unverified_role_icon.png" color="#de0000" />.

If this still does not work, the **Head Moderator** may decide to close the ticket and let it be logged as "unresponsive".
:::
  - Remove the member from the ticket after member acknowledges the warning/punishment using `/remove` ticket bot command.

## Logging the Ticket

- A <RoleBadge role="Server Committee Member" badgeIcon="server_committee_role_icon.webp" color="#db1cb8" /> will guide you on how to log the ticket into the **GitHub Warning Book**.
