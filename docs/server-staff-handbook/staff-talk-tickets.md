# Staff-Talk Tickets (Moderators Only)
:::info
**For the first 2 months** as a Moderator, draft your messages in **#ðŸ“™moderator-only** and get approval from Head Mods/Server Committee before opening tickets.
:::
## Important Guidelines

- **Punishment/Action Tickets**:

  - Must be opened by **Staff**.
  - Do **not** give out punishments in tickets started by a member.
  - **Never** start the ticket by stating the punishment.
:::note Reminder
While these tickets will be used to dish out a punishment, we still wanna treat the members well!
:::


## **Setting up a Ticket** 
  1. Go to **#open-a-ticket** and select **"Talk to a Staff"** button.
  2. Rename the ticket using `/rename` to: `Stafftalk-Username`.
  3. Add the user to the ticket with `/add`.



<details>
<summary> **Communicating with the Member** </summary>
<p>
  - Ping the user and request their time.
  - Share evidence of the rule they broke.
  - Explain the rule and how they violated it.

    - Please do not argue with the member.
  - If it gets to be too much, tag out for another Moderator in **#ðŸ“™moderator-only**.
  :::warning Don't Stress!
  Remain calm and objective! If you feel yourself getting frustrated, please just do an "Irish Goodbye" from the ticket and ask for help!

<details>
<summary> **Issuing Punishments** </summary>
<p>
  - Inform them of the punishment according to the **Staff Guidelines** and ask them to acknowledge the punishment.
  :::warning

Do not remove the member before they have acknowledged the punishment. This is very important, as it is the only way for us to prove that they have read and understood what they did wrong and the warning or punishment they are getting for it. If they do not respond within two weeks or you see them very clearly being active in other parts of the server and intentionally ignoring the ticket, you may ask the rest of the mod team about **temporarily removing their verifcation until they respond**.

If this still does not work, the Head Moderator may decide to close the ticket and let it be logged as "unresponsive".
:::
  - Remove the member from the ticket after issuing the warning or timeout using `/remove`.
</p>
</details>
## Logging the Ticket

- A **Server Committee member** will guide you on how to log the ticket into the **GitHub Warning Book**.

Properly handling tickets ensures transparency and fairness for members involved!
