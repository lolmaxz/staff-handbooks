# Mod on Call (Moderators Only)

The **Mod on Call** is responsible for closing out tickets and updating the GitHub records for the week.

## Selection Process

- **Every Friday**, a member of the **Server Committee** or the **Head Moderator** opens a thread in **#helperchat**.
- Moderators roll a die using `/roll sides20` with YAGPDB bot.
- In true D&D fashion, the Mod with the **lowest roll** becomes the Mod on Call until the next Friday!
  - In case of a tie, previous week's Mod on Call wins the tie.
  - Other Mods who tie will roll again.

- If the **Head Moderator** or **A Server Committee** member doesn't start the roll thread by **midnight EST**, they will take over the duties by default.

:::note
This process helps ensures fair rotation of responsibilities and makes it fun!
