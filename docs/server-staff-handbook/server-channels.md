# Server Staff Channels üõ°Ô∏è

Once your application to be part of the server staff has been accepted, you will receive the necessary role(s), granting you access to server-specific channels.

:::info Reminder!
**Make sure to check the channels from the [General Handbook](../general-handbook/staff-channels) first!**
:::

## Text Channels

- <ChannelBadge label="üìóhelper-chat" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/737215117049069610" />: This channel is where new server staff begins and where they report things they see on the server or any issues with a verification ticket. It's the main channel for moderators to become.

- <ChannelBadge label="üìômoderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474" />: This channel is where moderators (those who got promoted from cutie helper to moderator) discuss any issues on the server, from trouble makers, rule violation handlings to helping out with verification as well and some discussions about bans and other moderative actions.

- <ChannelBadge label="üü©-kicks-bans-logs" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/781628317925244978" />: This is where most of the ban and kick commands are executed, so we can keep a clean channel only for the kicks and bans. It's easier to find back a ban or a kick. Both helpers and moderators can access this channel.

- <ChannelBadge label="üü©-test" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/737209181945462834" />: The test channel is perfect for new staff as well as long time staff to test new bot commands to make sure the understanding is all correct. It's also often used to do the `/info` command to get information about a member.

- <ChannelBadge label="üü©-staff-logs" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/741167289813958718" />: Is the most important channel when it comes to user joining, leaving, deleting messages or editing messages. Any channel modification also gets logged in there. This is only for the channel at the level which helpers can see. There are other undisclosed staff-logs channels for higher level of logs, which are essentially the same logs but for events happening in higher level of staff. To avoid leakage of information from higher staff channels!

- <ChannelBadge label="üîó-vrchat-age-logs" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1319750107859779725" />: Perfect channel to know when someone gets age cross verified using their VRChat account linked! This is the best place to look if you wanna make sure that someone got properly age verified and acts as a log for us to know who used our system.

- <ChannelBadge label="‚èπÔ∏è-role-changes" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1424116477727866920" />: This one is like the staff-logs, except it logs only the role changes on members. Whenever they receive a role or a role is removed, we will know about it. We even know who gives a role to who.

- <ChannelBadge label="üìúwatchlist" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1400585278875369553" />: A relatively new channel only moderators can see (no helper can see it), in which detailed information is written and kept track of about individuals likely to cause issues in the community or whom have maybe crossed some lines even if no rules breaking were done, properly speaking. You get access to this channel once you become a moderator.

## Voice Channels

- <ChannelBadge variant="vc" label="üìô Moderators VC" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1024395419276542064" />: This is the VC in which Moderators might talk to discuss either ongoing problems or to host moderators only meetings.
