# Server Rule Violations

When a member breaks a server rule, follow these steps to ensure proper handling and documentation.

## Reporting Process

### Staff Reporting

- <RoleBadge role="Chat Moderator" color="#ff6b6b" /> and any other members of the <RoleBadge role="Event Breed" badgeIcon="event_host_role_icon.png" color="#f75edb" /> report issues in <ChannelBadge label="â­•server-chat-reports" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1234567890123456789"/>
- <RoleBadge role="Cutie Helper" badgeIcon="cutie_helper_role_icon.png" color="#38c8e8" /> and <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> report in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“—helper-chat" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1234567890123456789"/>

### Member Reports

- If a member reports an issue in a ticket, a <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> handles it
- Gather essential details: **Who**, **Where**, and **When**
- Don't just thank them; ask for necessary information

## Documentation Requirements

When documenting a rule violation:

1. **Screenshot** the violation
2. **Specify** which rule was broken
3. **Delete** the violating post from the channel
4. **Record** all relevant details

## Moderation Process

1. **Confirm** the violation in a **Staff-Talk ticket**
2. **Discuss** appropriate punishment in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“™moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/> following the Server Guidelines
