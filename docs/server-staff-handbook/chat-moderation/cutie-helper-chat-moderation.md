# Cutie Helper Chat Moderation

Not everything in chat requires escalating to a ticket. As a Cutie Helper, your responsibilities include:

- **Directing Members**:

  - Guide users to the appropriate channels.
  - Encourage reading channel descriptions or pinned messages.

- **Enforcing Use of Templates**:

  - Remind members to use provided templates where applicable.
    - Do this by replying to the wrongful message with pinging on (make sure the popup over your textbox says "**@ ON**", and not "**@ OFF**") and then delete the wrongful messaage. This way the person who made mistake will get a ping telling them what they did wrong, but nobody else will be able to see who made the mistake. 
    - The channels that have templates are the ones under the **︵‿୨ 🔍 LOOKING FOR 🔎୧‿︵⋆** category, as well as **#📄𝘕𝘚𝘍𝘞-𝘉ios**, and the templates can be found by going to the pinned message in those channels.
- **Handling Minor Infractions**:

  - Politely address minor issues directly in the chat.
  - No need for formal warnings unless rules are being broken.

- **Screenshotting and Deleting**:

  - Capture evidence of any rule violations.
  - Delete messages that violate server rules (e.g., inappropriate images).
  - After deletion, please post your screenshot(s) in **#📗helper-chat** so the mod team can more easily keep track of your work.

:::note
Always remain professional and courteous when interacting with members.
