# Cutie Helper Chat Moderation

Not everything in chat requires escalating to a ticket. As a <RoleBadge role="Cutie Helper" badgeIcon="cutie_helper_role_icon.png" color="#38c8e8" />, your responsibilities include:

- **Directing Members**:

  - Guide users to the appropriate channels.
  - Encourage reading channel descriptions or pinned messages.

- **Enforcing Use of Templates**:

  - Remind members to use provided templates where applicable.
    - Do this by replying to the wrongful message with pinging on (make sure the popup over your textbox says <RoleBadge role=" ON" color="#3b82f6" />, and not <RoleBadge role=" OFF" color="#6b7280" />) and then delete the wrongful message. This way the person who made mistake will get a ping telling them what they did wrong, but nobody else will be able to see who made the mistake.
    - The channels that have templates are the ones under the **Ô∏µ‚Äø‡≠® üîç LOOKING FOR üîé‡≠ß‚ÄøÔ∏µ‚ãÜ** category, as well as <ChannelBadge label="üìÑùòïùòöùòçùòû-ùòâios" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/737074569319546921"/>, and the templates can be found by going to the pinned message in those channels.

- **Handling Minor Infractions**:

  - Politely address minor issues directly in the chat.
  - No need for formal warnings unless rules are being broken.

- **Screenshotting and Deleting**:

  - Capture evidence of any rule violations.
  - Delete messages that violate server rules (e.g., inappropriate images).
  - After deletion, please post your screenshot(s) in <ChannelBadge label="üìóhelper-chat" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1234567890123456789"/> so the mod team can more easily keep track of your work.
