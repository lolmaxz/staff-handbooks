  - Intervene in heated discussions to calm the situation.
  - Encourage respectful communication.

- **Issuing Timeouts**:

  - You may issue **1-hour timeouts** without a ticket to stop ongoing arguments.

  - Remove off-topic messages to maintain the channel's purpose.
  - Ensure the conversation aligns with the channel guidelines.

## Guidelines
