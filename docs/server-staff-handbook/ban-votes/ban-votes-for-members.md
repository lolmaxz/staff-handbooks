# Ban Votes for Members (Moderators Only)

:::warning
All ban votes are held in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“™moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/> and last **24 hours**.

## Initiating a Ban Vote

- Any <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> can initiate a ban vote in accordance with the **Server Guidelines**
- Create a **thread** in <ChannelBadge label="ðŸ“™moderator-only" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/943466763314663474"/> to discuss:
  - The rule(s) broken
  - Why the member deserves a ban

## Voting Process

- The thread is open for **24 hours**
- All <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> must:

  - Cast their vote
  - Provide input or reasoning
  - State if they are abstaining and why

- If a <RoleBadge role="Moderator" badgeIcon="moderator_role_icon.png" color="#e68027" /> is unavailable due to IRL commitments, inform the <RoleBadge role="Head Moderator" color="#e68027" />

## After the Vote

- Once the **24-hour** period is over, the outcome is carried out
- If the ban is approved:
  - Bring the member into a ticket to inform them
  - Proceed with the ban following proper procedures

- Use the command `>votereact [message ID]` to create a vote
- **Copy the message ID** by right-clicking the message and selecting **"Copy ID"**
