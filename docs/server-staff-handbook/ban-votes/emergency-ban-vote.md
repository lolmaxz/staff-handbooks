# Emergency Ban Vote (Admins Only)

In rare cases where a member poses a serious disruption or safety concern.

## Process

- <RoleBadge role="Lewd Governor" color="#ff6b6b" /> and one department head will hold an emergency ban vote
- If an Admin is unavailable, they may appoint a **replacement representative**

### Replacement Representatives

- **Maxie** (<RoleBadge role="Lewd Governor" color="#ff6b6b" />): <RoleBadge role="HR" color="#ff6b6b" />
- **Lulu** (<RoleBadge role="Lewd Governor" color="#ff6b6b" />) or **Krenki** (<RoleBadge role="Lewd Governor" color="#ff6b6b" />): <RoleBadge role="Head Moderator" color="#e68027" /> / <RoleBadge role="Event Manager" color="#f75edb" />

## Guidelines

- These ban votes do **not** require a 24-hour wait.
- Immediate action is taken as soon as TWO votes in favor are casted to ensure the safety of the community.
