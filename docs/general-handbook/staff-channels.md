    <p>- Cutie helpers and moderators may report things directly in **#üìóhelper-chat** or **#üìômoderator-only** instead of using this channel.<br/>
    Simply provide the message link to the problematic post and explain why you think it needed to be reported. The server team will handle the rest. <br/>
    If you are unsure if something should be reported, it is always better to report it and let the server team decide if it needs to be addressed. <br/>
    ANY staff member can report a message, but only server staff can handle the reports. This is just a faster direct line of communication for staff to report messages.</p>
