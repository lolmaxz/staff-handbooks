# Going on Hiatus

In the case you should need time away from your staff duties, any member of staff has the option to go on hiatus and keep thier role. This may be for any reason, be it bereavement, military deployment, work obligations, etc. please reach out to the <RoleBadge role="Head Moderator ðŸ”°" badgeIcon="" color="#db1cb8" />  or <RoleBadge role="Event Team Head" badgeIcon="event_head_role_icon.png" color="#f75edb" /> if you need a break along with a reason/estimated length of time you'll be absent. 

:::note Expectations 
We all have lives outside of Eden and though we hope for the best, sometimes life gets in the way and that's alright. All we ask is that you **communicate** with your respective Head regarding life's many obstacles.
