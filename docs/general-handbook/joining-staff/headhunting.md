Some might say a "Diamond in the Rough of VR", "Kinky Kinkster with a glowing personality", "Yo ERP!"
One of our lovely staff reccommended you to one of our <RoleBadge role="Committee Members"  color="#db1cb8" /> and now you are on the fast track for becoming a part of the team!

You hacked the system and bypassed the Application phase but instead will just follow the Interview Phase of Joining Staff before reaching Staff Orientation! 

:::note Chat Moderator
Another role to be selected for is our anonymous chat moderators who are active members of the community who gain access to our <ChannelBadge label="â­•server-chat-reports" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/996504897476366497"/> in order to make reports directly to moderators without needing to open a ticket!
