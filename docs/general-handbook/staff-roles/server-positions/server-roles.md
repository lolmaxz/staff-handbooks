## Server Chat Moderators {#server-chat-moderators}

**Server Chat Moderators** are active community members who assist staff to report problems in the server chat channels.

<h3> Responsibilities: </h3>

- Watch the server for any rule breakers and report incidents without needing to open tickets.
- They do not have special roles displayed, so members are unaware of their status.
- No application is required; the position is offered based on the server's needs, members activity level, and desire to assist in keeping the community safe.
- **Server chat moderators do not have any moderation powers**

:::note
Being anonymous helps Chat Moderators observe the server chat without having any special roles displayed. (It's an invisible position)
