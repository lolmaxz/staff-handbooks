# How to Take Staff Pictures 📸

As staff, we love to showcase you in our world with a nice picture! These pictures are also used for our yearly New Year big group staff picture.

**Submit your pictures here:** <ChannelBadge variant="thread" label="📸 Staff World Picture Selection" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/1205298011450638357" />

## 📋 Pose Requirements

- **Standing position** - Not lying down, not sitting. If you aren't sure, submit and ping staff for confirmation. Some exceptions may apply (like being upside down, but check first!)
- **Looking at the camera** - Please face the camera directly
  - _I know VRChat camera can be a pain for this, blame them not me!_
- **Eyes opened** - Whenever possible
- **Full body visible** - The whole body should appear in the picture. If you have a tail or big hat, etc., make sure **NOTHING** is clipped outside the picture's frame!
- **Stay SFW** - At least for your main picture. If you want to take some NSFW pictures afterward, that's up to you, but obviously we won't use NSFW pictures for public-facing staff images.

## 🎥 Camera Setup

### Resolution

- **4K or higher** - 1080p will most likely be rejected!

### Background

- **Transparent Background** → Go to `Mask` and turn off `World` layer.
- Make sure the **camera is looking straight** at your avatar's face, perpendicular to the ground (90°)
