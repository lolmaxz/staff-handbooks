# Group Instance Rules

## Verified Role Requirement

**All Group instances must be limited to the Verified group role minimum.**

## Not Official Events

**You understand that any Group Instances are not official Eden Apis' events and may not be hosted by Eden Apis staff.**

## Allowed Activities

Keep any self hosted small events in group instances to social gathering, movies, meeting up, games or even basic lewd.

:::warning
Don't do any serious events using our group instances please. (ie; no Orgy events, Free use, Nude, Hunt, etc)

## Event Schedule Check

Please check to make sure that any group instances **do not** overlap with any upcoming scheduled events. (See <ChannelBadge variant="post" label="üìÜÔΩúevents-schedule" link="https://discord.com/channels/734595073920204940/820927836411002890" />)
