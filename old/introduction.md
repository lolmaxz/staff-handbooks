Welcome to the Event Team! Thank you for your interest in helping shape our community and entertain our members. Eden Apis strives to foster a safe and fun environment for everyone. This handbook outlines everything you need to know as a Host or Security member. You'll be guided through all the steps needed to ensure our events are as enjoyable as possible for all community members!

:::note
As part of Eden Apis staff, Hosts and Security are expected to maintain professionalism and courtesy with both staff and community members. While we understand not everyone will be best friends, we expect respectful interactions and avoidance of unnecessary drama.
