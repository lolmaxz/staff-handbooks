# Event Trial Training

After acceptance as an Event Team member, you will receive the **Event Trial** role and access to event channels.

They consist of both security and host training, including:

1. **Security Shadowing (2 Events)**: Observe a Senior Event Team member performing security duties and learn from their experience.

2. **Security While Observed (1 Event)**: Act as the main security with oversight from a Senior Team member, who will help with any questions you may have.

3. **Co-Hosting (1 Event)**: Share hosting responsibilities, applying learned skills while still supported by a Senior Team member.

4. **Solo Hosting with Co-Host Support (1 Event)**: Lead an event with backup from a Senior Team member as co-host, allowing you to become more confident.

5. **Solo Hosting with Shadowing Host (1 Event)**: Conduct an event independently while a Senior Host observes, demonstrating your full capability in managing an event.
