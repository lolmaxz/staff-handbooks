# Host Discretion List

The **Host Discretion List** allows hosts to restrict certain members from attending their events.

## Adding a Member to Your Discretion List

- **Process**:

  - Contact the **Event Team Head** or an **Event Committee** member.
  - Provide a valid and substantial reason for the request.

- **Criteria**:

  - A really good reason is required to add a member to your discretion list.
  - Simple dislike of a member or issues with an ex will not be accepted as a reason.

- **Notification**:

  - The member will be notified by **A Member of The Committee** or **The Head of Event Team** through a ticket.
  - They will be informed that they won't be able to attend your events anymore or for a specific event.

The discretion list is meant to maintain a comfortable environment for hosts while ensuring fairness and transparency.
