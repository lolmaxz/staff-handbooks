## Channels to Familiarize With

- **#ðŸ“˜events-organization**: Discussions related to event planning.
- **#ðŸ“˜special-event-planning**: Planning for special events (each event has its own post).
- **#ðŸ”ºevents-incidents**: Reporting any incidents that occur during events.
- **#ðŸ“˜active-event-vc**: Voice channel for active event staff during events.
- **#ðŸ“˜active-event-vc-2**: Additional voice channel for active event staff.
- **#ðŸ“˜security-vc**: Voice channel for the security team to discuss important matters.
- **#â­•server-chat-reports**: Report any chat messages that may violate server rules. Simply provide the message link and reason for reporting; the server team will handle the rest.
