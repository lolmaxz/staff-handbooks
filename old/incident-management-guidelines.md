# Incident Management Guidelines

## General Guidelines

1. **Primary Responsibility**: Event Security is tasked with maintaining order. Their main role is to address troublemakers promptly to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all server members.

2. **Issuing Warnings**:

   - Security should issue warnings whenever possible.
   - If no security member is available, Hosts can step in.
   - Speak clearly and firmly when delivering a verbal warning.

3. **Handling Offenders**:

   - Move the offending member(s) away from others, ensuring privacy during the discussion.
   - Collect detailed information about the incident.
   - Observe the member's behavior, noting any aggression for the incident report.

4. **Logging Incidents**:

   - After dealing with the situation, log the incident in **#events-incidents**.
   - Include:

     - Offender's Discord Tag (without pinging them).
     - Detailed account of the incident:

       - Specific rules broken.
       - All people involved.
       - Notable statements made during the incident and discussion.

     - Disciplinary actions taken.

## Specific Rule Violations and Actions

- **Broken Consent**:

  - Includes unwanted physical contact, boundary violations, coercion into ERP, and advances on non-consenting members.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning and/or removal from the event (for serious consent breaks).

- **Disorderly Conduct**:

  - Includes being excessively loud, using offensive language, inciting violence, and triggering members' sensitivities.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning to cease immediately; removal at team's discretion.

- **Inciting Drama**:

  - Involves speaking negatively about members or staff, spreading rumors, igniting debates, or discussing server tickets inappropriately.
  - **Action**: Verbal warning to cease immediately.

:::warning Host Authority
At any time, you have the right as the host to remove any rule breaker from your ongoing event if you consider it the appropriate course of action. Coordinate with security to fill in the incident report on Discord.
